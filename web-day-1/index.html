    <h2>Things to eat in Seoul as soon as I get back home</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3><li>Sogum-Bbang</li></h3>
            <img src="assets/sogum.jpg" width="500" length="500" alt="an image of several brown breads">
            <p>This soft, puffy bread is called Sogum-bbang, a.k.a. Salt Bread. This is one of the foods I miss the most; its saltiness and richness of butter, melting softly in your mouth. Pair it with a cup of Milk Tea, you could taste heaven.</p>
        <h4>These are some places I recommend to try Sogum-Bbang:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Milomil</li>
                    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/milomil_/">Instagram</a>
                <li>Saltroom:</li>

                <li>Huwahuwa</li>

            </ul>

        <h3><li>Truffle Jjajangmeon</li></h3>
            <p>Yes I miss Jjajangmeon, but I REALLY miss Truffle Jjajangmeon. Jjajangmeon is Korean-Chinese food, which means it is sold as Chinese food in Korea, but it does not actually exit in China. You can only tase Jjajangmeon in Korea, but Truffle Jjajangmeon is exclusive to Hyundai Departmentstore in Seoul. Jjajanmeon's umami and truffle oil's rich fragrance swirls in your mouth, and once it's gone, in your mind, forever.</p>
        <h3><li>Labaz Fraisier</li></h3>
            <p>This might be the fluffiest, lightest, freshest strawberry cake in the entire world. Labaz is a desert cafe located near where I live, and they bake limited amount of deserts each day. Thier signature Fraisier is my favorite, as it just vanishes in your mouth as soon as you put it in your mouth, leaving fresh fragrance of strawberry, lemon, and cream.</p>
        <h3><li>Tteokbokki</li></h3>
            <p>There are Tteokbokkis here in the US too, but they are just different.</p>
        <h3><li>Home Kimchi</li></h3>
            <p>All Koreans' soul food, Kimchi. But ironically Kimchi tastes totally different from household to houshold, because recipies vary. I want my mom's Kimchi.</p>
